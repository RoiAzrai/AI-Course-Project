## Project Overview

This project comprises a set of problem-solving exercises designed to enhance understanding of artificial intelligence concepts. Each exercise explores a different topic, including search algorithms, game theory, decision trees, and more.

## Assignments

### Exercise 1: Kings and Bishops - Part I

- **Objective:** Implement the A* search algorithm to solve a board game problem where the objective is to move kings and bishops on a 6x6 board to reach a goal configuration.
- **Key Concepts:** A* search algorithm, heuristic functions, board game simulation.
- **Details:** The board consists of kings, bishops, and obstacles. The goal is to find the optimal sequence of moves to transition from the starting board to the goal board.

### Exercise 2: Kings and Bishops - Part II

- **Objective:** Extend the board game problem by implementing various search algorithms, including hill climbing, simulated annealing, local beam search, and genetic algorithms.
- **Key Concepts:** Heuristic search, optimization, hill climbing, simulated annealing, local beam search, genetic algorithms.
- **Details:** This exercise builds upon the previous one by introducing additional search strategies. The algorithms are compared based on their performance in finding the optimal solution.

### Exercise 3: Predicting Smoking Using Decision Trees

- **Objective:** Use decision trees to predict whether a person is a smoker based on various health indicators.
- **Key Concepts:** Decision tree algorithm, entropy, χ2 pruning, k-fold cross-validation.
- **Details:** The exercise involves building a decision tree using health data, setting thresholds for continuous variables, and evaluating the model using cross-validation. All decision tree functions are implemented from scratch, without using external libraries.

### Exercise 4: Formalizing Games, Voting, and Cake Cutting

- **Objective:** Solve problems related to game theory, voting paradoxes, and fair division.
- **Key Concepts:** Normal-form games, dominant strategies, Nash equilibrium, Pareto optimality, Condorcet consistency, cake-cutting algorithms.
- **Details:** This exercise covers various theoretical problems such as modeling Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock, proving voting paradoxes, and analyzing the fairness of a cake-cutting algorithm.
